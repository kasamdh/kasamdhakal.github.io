			<h1 text-align="center">World Population</h1>
			<p><h5>This narrative offers a visual representation of the global population distributed across countries and the quality of life experienced in each nation. The world population, which stands at an estimated 7.7 billion as of April 2019, reflects the total number of people currently inhabiting the planet. Interestingly, it took more than 200,000 years for the global population to reach 1 billion, but a mere additional 200 years to surge to 7 billion.
				Furthermore, the visualization encompasses the growth of the world population from 1960 to 2017, taking into account various influencing factors. Additionally, the narrative highlights the varying levels of quality of life experienced in different countries, allowing a comparative assessment of which nations offer the highest standards of living.</h5></p>
			<h3>Section 1 </h3>
			<p>In this section, I present the depiction of the global population distribution in the year 2017. To achieve this visualization, a geo-map was utilized, allowing us to view the data geographically. When hovering the mouse cursor over specific countries on the map, additional information is revealed, including the country's rank based on population and the actual population figure for the year 2017. China currently holds the title of the world's most populous country, boasting a population surpassing 1.4 billion people. Remarkably, there are only two countries globally with populations exceeding 1 billion, and India is the second one. As of 2017, India's population stands at over 1.355 billion individuals, and it is projected to experience continued growth until at least 2050. By the year 2030, India is anticipated to take over as the most populous nation on Earth. Beyond India and China, the next 11 most populous countries each have populations surpassing 100 million. These countries include the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Ethiopia, and the Philippines. While most of these nations are expected to continue growing, Russia and Japan are exceptions. Both countries are projected to witness a decline in their populations by 2030, with further significant decreases anticipated by 2050.</p>
			
			<h3>Section 2</h3>
			<p>When it comes to choosing the best country to live in, the answer you come up with might differ from the answers of other people, especially because it all depends on what you are using to define a country as being the best. Whether itâ€™s happiness levels, overall financial stability, type of climate, or something completely unrelated to any of these suggestions, the definition of the number one country to live in is entirely subjective., however this visualization allows us to see different countries and their relative ranking on following parameters</p>
			<ul type="disc">
			<li>Quality of Life</li></li>Purchasing Power</li><li>Safety</li></li>Health Care</li><li>Cost of Living</li><li>Property Price to Income Ratio</li><li>Traffic Commute Time</li><li>Pollution</li><li>Climate</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Section 3</h3>
			<p>This visualization allows us to view the growth of World Population from 1960 to 2017, gowth was very rapid - the global population is more than doubled. This data is taken from United Nations Population Division.In this visulation we have tip at the bottom which will show us the year and respective year population.</p>
